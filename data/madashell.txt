We know things are bad – worse than bad. They’re crazy. 
It’s like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don’t go out anymore. 
We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, 
and all we say is: ‘Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. 
Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won’t say anything. 
Just leave us alone.’


Well, I’m not gonna leave you alone. 
I want you to get MAD! 
I don’t want you to protest. 
I don’t want you to riot – 
I don’t want you to write to your congressman, because 
I wouldn’t know what to tell you to write. 
I don’t know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. 
All I know is that first you’ve got to get mad. 
You’ve got to say: ‘I’m a human being, god-dammit! My life has value!’

So, I want you to get up now. 
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. 
I want you to get up right now and go to the window. 
Open it, and stick your head out, and yell: 
‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’
